My Role In This project :
In model building I have covered almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools this project covers: 
1. Python  
2. NumPy 
3. Pandas for data cleaning; 
4. Matplotlib for data visualization; 
5. Sklearn for model building
